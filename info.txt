## programmable longitudinal maneuvers

probably use with chill mode for reproducible planning

### Maneuver object
jump instantaneously to velocity at next point,
or interpolate smoothly

{
  duration: 14, // seconds
  should_interpolate: false,
  points: [
    // time, velocitymph
    {0, 0},
    {5, 10},
    {8, 10},
    {12, 2},
    {14, 0},
  ],
}

### maneuver execution
once maneuver is selected and commanded
override setspeed from cruisestate with points from maneuver

### web app
c3 hosted web app to choose maneuver, start/stop, view progress
start with a few maneuvers to choose from

maybe later add a graph to display progress on phone
